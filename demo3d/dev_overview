model: <- VBO

Octree abstraction:
 Insert object:
  Inserts object at needed position in tree
 Optimize tree:
  Removes unnessesary nodes
 move relative origin:
  Moves the relative origin of tree. Keeps LOD
 
 ND / 3d rectagle lookup, exclusive inclusive:

a bit harder. Purposes:
 1. Rendering scene
 2. Collision detection
 3. AI wants to investigate area

 Field of view lookup:
 1. rendering of scene.

1: restructure octree to use the generic vectors X
2: Setup graphics core X
2: Setup a 3D rendering shader program X
2: Setup RT / projections. 
3: Render 3D polygon X
4: Render GameObject
4:Test matrix vector mult
5: Insert gameObject in octreenode
6: Render gameobjects in octreenode
7: Make cached octree
8: Render gameobjects in cached octree
9: Dynamic load objects in cached octree
10: Enable events
11: Move around in 3d
12: Move around in octree
13: Make physics for AABBs. 
14: Test collisions, collision handling
15: Test collisions in octree
16: relative positioning
